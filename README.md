# Cpnt200 - a1- Static Website with PHP Includes

## Comments

This project is based on my [CPNT260-Final Project](https://github.com/yanlinchen1985/cpnt260-final). I completed it easily by following my instructor's steps. It seems no any big issue because it seems similar to the Express EJS assignment.
